# learn to program
Resources for a class I'm teaching.

Grab a zip of the files here:
https://github.com/tdresser/learn_to_program/archive/master.zip

Double click on setup.bat.
Follow the instructions!

This sets up cygwin (a bunch of tools which let you do linux'ish things) and atom.io (a decent text editor).

Windows should have a "Cygwin Terminal" shortcut in the start menu.
